## Evaluating the Viability of Micro-Scale Pumped Hydro System for Energy Storage

### Goals

The goals of this project were to:
- Develop micro-scale pumped hydro systems that can be taken anywhere in the world, even when there isnâ€™t existing irrigation infrastructure.
- Build on previous work by [Mousavi et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261919319713)
- Determine if a simpler mathematical model could be just as effective (or even more effective) when considering small-scale systems.
